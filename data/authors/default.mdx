I'm a software engineer who writes about the craft of building things.

This site is where I explore what's actually working in modern development - from AI-assisted coding workflows to creative projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in the browser. I write practical guides, share interactive demos, and give honest takes on the tools shaping how we build software.

## What I'm Working On

**AI-Assisted Development** - I've been deep in the shift to agent-first coding. Most of my programming now happens in English, directing LLMs to write and refactor code. I write about what's working, what's breaking, and where this is all heading.

**Creative Coding** - I build interactive experiences that blur the line between art and engineering. From browser-based games to physics simulations, I'm interested in what happens when you treat the web as a creative medium.

**Developer Tools** - I care about the infrastructure that makes development faster and more reliable. Deployment pipelines, testing strategies, accessibility tooling - the unglamorous work that compounds over time.

## The Site

rkRanched runs on Next.js with MDX for content. The source is [open on GitHub](https://github.com/raffik16/rkliveblog). I use Claude Code for most of the development work now, which has become a topic I write about frequently.

## Get in Touch

I'm most active on [X/Twitter](https://x.com/RKeklikian) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/raffikeklikian). Feel free to reach out - I'm always interested in conversations about engineering, AI, and what we're building.
