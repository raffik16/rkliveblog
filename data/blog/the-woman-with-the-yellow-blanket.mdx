Her name is Teresa. I didn't know that until last week.

For three months, she's been a fixture on the Expo Line—the westbound train that takes me from downtown to Culver City where I work in a startup that thinks we're changing the world. She boards at Pico with a shopping cart and a yellow blanket that's so bright it seems obscene against the gray reality of her situation.

## The First Time I Really Saw Her

The first time I really *saw* Teresa—not just glanced and looked away—was on a Tuesday morning in August. Summer in LA, which means the metro is a sauna with wheels. She was sitting on the floor of the train car, her back against the wall, that yellow blanket draped over her shopping cart like she was trying to give it dignity.

She wasn't asking for money. Wasn't causing a scene. She was just... existing. And somehow, that felt more uncomfortable than anything else. Because existing shouldn't be a disruption. But on the Expo Line at rush hour, it is.

A businessman in a suit stepped over her legs without breaking stride. Didn't even look down. Like she was a crack in the sidewalk. An obstacle. Not a person.

I wanted to say something. To him. To her. To anyone. But what do you say? "Excuse me, sir, you just stepped over a human being"? "Ma'am, are you okay?" when clearly, *clearly*, nothing is okay?

So I did what everyone does. I looked at my phone and pretended the world wasn't breaking right in front of me.

## The Yellow Blanket

Over the weeks, I started noticing things. The yellow blanket was always clean. Or at least, cleaner than it should be for someone living on the streets. She must have been washing it somewhere. Keeping up appearances, even when appearances were all she had left.

Her cart was organized. One side for clothes, neatly folded in plastic bags. Another side for what looked like documents in a water-damaged folder. And always, always, a gallon jug of water, usually half-full.

She had a routine. Board at Pico. Ride to Expo/Bundy. Get off. Wait for the eastbound train. Ride it back. Repeat. All day. Every day.

The train was her living room. Her bedroom. Her refuge from the streets of Los Angeles, where being homeless is treated like a crime and existing without a roof is seen as a moral failing.

## The Day Everything Changed

Last Tuesday, something snapped in me. Or maybe something finally fell into place. Teresa boarded the train, and I watched a teenage girl literally plug her nose and move to another car. The girl couldn't have been more than sixteen. Already trained to treat human suffering like a bad smell you can walk away from.

I thought about my own daughter. Thirteen years old. Safe at home. Never had to sleep on a train or wash a blanket in a public bathroom. And I thought: What if that was her? What if some series of disasters I can't even imagine led to my kid being the one with a shopping cart and a yellow blanket?

So I did the thing we're not supposed to do. I engaged.

"Excuse me," I said, sitting down on the floor next to her. People stared. Of course they stared. "Is there anything you need? Water? Food?"

She looked at me like I'd spoken in a foreign language. Like kindness was the most unexpected thing that had happened to her in months. Maybe it was.

"I'm okay," she said. Her voice was quiet but clear. Educated. This wasn't someone who grew up on the streets. This was someone who fell there.

"I'm David," I said.

She hesitated. Then: "Teresa."

## Teresa's Story (The Parts She Told Me)

We talked for three stops. Pico to La Cienega. She told me fragments of her story—the parts she was willing to share with a stranger on a train.

She was a teacher. Elementary school. Had an apartment in Koreatown. Then her mom got sick. Dementia. Teresa took time off work to care for her. Used up her savings. Maxed out credit cards. Her mom died anyway. Teresa fell apart. Lost her job. Couldn't pay rent. And just like that—three months from stable to sleeping on trains.

"It happens faster than you think," she said, clutching that yellow blanket. "One day you're okay. The next day, you're not. And the city doesn't catch you when you fall. It just watches you hit the ground."

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Here's the uncomfortable truth about homelessness in Los Angeles: it's not always what we think it is. It's not always addiction or mental illness or people who "don't want to work." Sometimes it's just people who got dealt a bad hand and couldn't recover. People like Teresa. Like Marcus on the Red Line. Like the thousands of invisible people we step over, around, and past every single day.

And the most uncomfortable truth of all: most of us are closer to that edge than we want to admit. A medical crisis. A job loss. A family emergency. How many of us are really more than a few paychecks away from that yellow blanket?

## What I'm Doing About It (Not Enough)

I bring Teresa coffee now. Black, two sugars. Sometimes a breakfast sandwich. It's not enough. It doesn't solve anything. She's still homeless. She's still riding the Expo Line all day because it's better than the alternative.

But she's not invisible anymore. Not to me.

And I'm not looking away anymore. Not from Teresa. Not from Marcus. Not from any of the people living in the margins of this city that claims to be so progressive, so enlightened, so *California*.

## The Question

The question I can't stop asking myself: In a city where the median rent is $2,800 a month and there are more luxury apartments going up than affordable housing units, what did we expect to happen?

Where did we think people would go?

The answer, apparently, is the Metro. The Red Line. The Expo Line. The Blue Line. All of them, full of people who have nowhere else to be. Riding circles around a city that's forgotten how to care for its most vulnerable.

Tomorrow, I'll see Teresa again. I'll bring her coffee. She'll say thank you. We'll chat for a few stops. Then I'll get off at Culver City and go to work and she'll keep riding.

And that yellow blanket will keep being the brightest thing on the train—a small act of defiance against a city that wants people like Teresa to disappear.

But she won't disappear. None of them will. They're here. They're real. They're us, if the circumstances were different.

And maybe if enough of us stop looking away, stop stepping over, stop pretending—maybe, just maybe, things could change.

Or maybe I'm just another person lying to myself on the Expo Line. Trying to feel better about a problem that's too big for coffee and breakfast sandwiches.

Either way, I'll be there tomorrow. With Teresa. With the yellow blanket. Bearing witness to the real Los Angeles.

The one they don't put on postcards.
