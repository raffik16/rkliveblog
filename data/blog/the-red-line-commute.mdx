Every morning at 7:15, I board the Red Line at Vermont/Sunset. The same commute for three years now. You'd think it would become background noise—the rumble of the tracks, the automated announcements, the hiss of the doors. But it never does. Not in Los Angeles. Not on this line.

## The Morning Regulars

There's Marcus. At least, I think that's his name. I heard someone call him that once. He's always in the same spot, third car from the front, slumped against the handicap seat with a duffle bag that looks like it's held together by hope and duct tape. His jacket—once blue, now a patchwork of stains and time—serves as his pillow.

The first few weeks, I looked away. We all do, don't we? It's easier. Pretend you're checking your phone. Scroll through emails you've already read. Anything to avoid eye contact, to avoid seeing yourself reflected in someone else's worst day that never seems to end.

But three years is a long time. Long enough that Marcus isn't a stranger anymore. He's part of the commute, as reliable as the train schedule—which isn't saying much in LA, but you get the point.

## The Unspoken Rules

There are rules on the Red Line. Unspoken ones. The housed and the unhoused share these train cars in a delicate dance of coexistence. We step around shopping carts. We pretend not to notice when someone's talking to voices only they can hear. We've learned to hold our breath through certain cars, where the smell of unwashed bodies and desperation hangs thick in the recycled air.

But we also share space. This morning, a woman with two young kids sat across from a man whose worldly possessions fit in a torn REI backpack. She didn't flinch. Didn't grab her kids and move. She smiled at him when he politely moved his bag to give them more room.

That moment—that tiny, mundane moment—that's Los Angeles. Real Los Angeles. Not the Hollywood sign. Not the beaches. Just people. Trying.

## The 7th Street Transfer

At 7th Street Metro Center, the train empties out like a tide. The business casual crowd floods onto the platform, merging with the Blue Line commuters. We move in programmed patterns, muscle memory guiding us through the underground maze. Coffee in hand. Headphones in. Eyes forward.

But some people don't get off. Marcus never gets off. He rides the line all day, I think. Back and forth. Union Station to North Hollywood and back again. It's warmer than the street. Safer, probably. The Metro security mostly leaves him alone as long as he's not causing trouble. And Marcus never causes trouble.

Sometimes I wonder what his story is. Was there a moment when everything fell apart? A job loss, an eviction, a medical bill that spiraled? Or was it slower than that—a series of small disasters that added up to one big catastrophe?

## The Cost of Looking Away

We're so good at looking away in this city. We have to be. There are too many people sleeping in doorways, too many tents lining the 101 underpass, too many stories of survival happening in plain sight. If we stopped and really looked at every one, we'd never make it to work. We'd break under the weight of all that suffering.

But here's what I've learned on the Red Line: you can't really look away. Not completely. Because when you share space with someone day after day—even if you never speak, even if you pretend they're invisible—they become part of your life. Part of your story.

Marcus is part of my story now. So is the young woman with the two trash bags and the hollow eyes who appeared last month. So is the older man who sits near the door and quietly asks for change in a voice that suggests he still can't believe this is his life.

## The Question We Don't Ask

The question hangs in the air of every morning commute: _How did we get here?_ How did we become a city where people pay $1.75 to ride trains all day because they have nowhere else to go? Where the housed and the unhoused share these metal boxes hurtling through underground tunnels, both trying to get somewhere, even if only one of us has somewhere to arrive?

I don't have answers. Just observations from the Red Line. Just stories from the daily commute. Just the raw truth that this is Los Angeles in 2025—beautiful and broken, wealthy and desperate, rushing forward while leaving so many behind.

Tomorrow morning, I'll board the train at 7:15 again. Marcus will probably be there. And I'll do what I've started doing lately: I'll nod in acknowledgment. It's not much. It doesn't solve anything. But it says: _I see you. You're still here. So am I._

Maybe that's all any of us can do. Keep riding. Keep seeing. Keep being human in a city that makes it so damn hard sometimes.

The Red Line rolls on.
