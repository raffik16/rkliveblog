I've never lived more than fifty miles from the Pacific Ocean. Not once in my thirty-eight years. That's not a flex—it's just a fact. Like having brown eyes or being left-handed. The West Coast isn't where I live. It's *who* I am.

## The Geography of Identity

There's something about growing up on the edge of a continent. The land ends. The water begins. And you spend your whole life existing in that liminal space between here and elsewhere. Between solid ground and infinite horizon.

I was born in San Diego. Grew up in Orange County. Did college in Santa Cruz. Worked in San Francisco. Now I'm in LA. Five cities, but really just one long stretch of coastline. Interstate 5 and Highway 1 are the arteries of my life, carrying me north and south but never east. Never away from the ocean.

People always ask: "Don't you want to see other places? Try New York? Chicago? Austin?"

And I do see other places. I travel. But living there? No. Because I know what would happen. I'd miss the way the light hits the water at sunset. I'd miss the eucalyptus trees that smell like medicine and memory. I'd miss knowing the ocean is there, even when I can't see it—a constant presence, like a heartbeat.

## The West Coast Code

We have our own language out here. Our own pace. Our own unspoken rules.

We don't honk. Well, we do in LA, but we feel bad about it.

We say "the" before freeway numbers. The 405. The 101. The 5. It drives east coasters crazy, which honestly makes it more fun.

We care about the weather but pretend we don't. "June Gloom" and "May Gray" are real seasons to us. When it actually rains, we lose our minds. Accidents everywhere. People driving fifteen miles per hour like the world is ending. Because to us, rain *is* extraordinary.

We wear hoodies in seventy-degree weather. We have strong opinions about burritos. We know the difference between NorCal and SoCal culture and will die on those hills. We've been in traffic jams that lasted longer than some people's commutes in other states. We've paid rent that would buy a mansion elsewhere and shrugged it off because: where else are you going to get this weather, this food, this ocean, this energy?

## The Cost of Paradise

But here's the thing they don't tell you about living in paradise: paradise is expensive. And complicated. And increasingly unequal.

The same California that gave me endless summers and beach bonfires and tacos from trucks at 2 AM also gave me a housing crisis. A homelessness epidemic. Wildfires that turn the sky orange. Traffic that steals hours of your life. Water shortages. Earthquakes waiting to happen.

The West Coast dream—the one that brought people here for the Gold Rush, for Hollywood, for Silicon Valley, for the promise of reinvention—that dream is harder to access now. Maybe impossible for some.

I see it on the Metro. I see it in the tent cities under overpasses. I see it in my friends who left for Portland or Seattle or Denver because they couldn't afford to stay. I see it every time I look at my rent and wonder how this became normal.

## Why I Stay

So why do I stay? Why not leave for somewhere cheaper, easier, more sensible?

Because this is my home. Not just geographically. Existentially.

Because on a random Tuesday, I can finish work and be at the beach in twenty minutes. Because I can have authentic Mexican food at midnight and dim sum at 6 AM. Because I can drive two hours and be in the mountains or the desert or wine country.

Because the Pacific Ocean at sunset looks like proof that beauty exists. Because the smell of jasmine on a warm night makes me believe in something larger than myself. Because this land—complicated and expensive and troubled as it is—this land raised me.

## The West Coast Paradox

Here's the West Coast paradox: we're both the future and the past. We're tech billionaires and street artists. Mansions in Malibu and tents in MacArthur Park. We're progressive politics and NIMBY neighbors. Renewable energy and traffic jams. Yoga studios and gun violence.

We contain multitudes, to borrow from Whitman. And sometimes those multitudes are at war with each other.

But maybe that's what it means to live on the edge of things. You get all the beauty and all the darkness. You get innovation and inequality. You get possibility and pain.

## The Myth vs. The Reality

The myth of the West Coast: endless sunshine, perfect bodies, Hollywood dreams, tech fortunes, spiritual awakenings.

The reality: yes to the sunshine (most days). No to the perfect bodies (unless you count perfect in their imperfection). The Hollywood dreams are mostly struggles. The tech fortunes belong to a lucky few. And spiritual awakening? Well, I've found more enlightenment sitting in traffic on the 10 than in any yoga class, so maybe.

But here's what the myth gets right: there's still possibility here. Still a sense that you can show up and become someone new. Reinvent yourself. Start over.

That's why people come here. That's why, despite everything, they stay.

That's why I've never left.

## Looking East (But Never Moving There)

Sometimes I look at the rest of America and wonder what it's like. What it's like to live where there are seasons. Real seasons. Snow. Fall colors. Thunderstorms that shake the windows.

What it's like to live where rent doesn't require selling organs. Where traffic isn't a fact of life. Where you can buy a house without being a millionaire or marrying one.

I wonder. But I don't envy. Because they don't have *this*.

They don't have the Pacific Coast Highway at dawn. They don't have Yosemite. They don't have Big Sur. They don't have a city like San Francisco, built on impossible hills. They don't have the energy of LA, chaotic and creative and infuriating and alive.

They don't have the West Coast. And I do. And I always will.

## Born Here, Buried Here

There's a saying in California: "Come for the weather, stay for... well, you can't afford to leave."

It's a joke. Mostly. But there's truth in it. This place gets into your blood. The light. The ocean. The mountains. The culture. The contradiction.

I'll probably die here. On the West Coast. Within sight of the Pacific. And honestly? I can't imagine it any other way.

Because some people are east coast. Some are midwest. Some are international nomads. But me? I'm west coast. Born and bound.

And when they scatter my ashes—probably somewhere along Highway 1, probably illegally, definitely with good intentions—I'll finally become permanent part of this coastline that made me who I am.

The edge of the continent. The edge of possibility. The edge of everything.

Home.
