The question comes up constantly: should I deploy on Vercel or Netlify?

I've deployed hundreds of projects across both platforms—from personal experiments to high-traffic production applications. Both are excellent. But they're optimized for different priorities, and choosing the right one can meaningfully impact your development experience and costs.

Let me break down the real differences.

## The TL;DR

**Choose Vercel if:**
- You're using Next.js (they made it—deep integration)
- Server-side rendering and edge functions are core to your app
- You want the simplest possible Next.js deployment
- You're willing to pay for optimized performance

**Choose Netlify if:**
- You're deploying static sites or non-Next.js frameworks
- You want more control over build pipelines and hosting
- Forms, identity, and large media are built-in requirements
- You prefer more transparent pricing at scale

Now let's get into the details.

## The Fundamental Difference

**Vercel** was built by the team that created Next.js. It's a deployment platform optimized first and foremost for Next.js, with support for other frameworks as a secondary concern.

**Netlify** pioneered the "Jamstack" approach—static site generation with serverless functions for dynamic features. They've expanded to support more dynamic frameworks, but their DNA is still in static sites with enhancement.

This philosophical difference shows up everywhere: in how they handle builds, how they price, what features they prioritize, and how they perform in production.

## Next.js Support: The Obvious Comparison

This is often the deciding factor, so let's address it directly.

### Vercel

Vercel's Next.js support is first-party. Every Next.js feature works out of the box:

- **App Router and Pages Router** — Full support for both
- **Server Components** — Native streaming and suspense
- **Server Actions** — Zero additional configuration
- **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)** — First-class support
- **Image Optimization** — Built-in, no setup required
- **Edge Runtime** — Seamlessly deployed to edge locations
- **Middleware** — Works as expected
- **Draft Mode** — For preview deployments

When Next.js releases a new feature, Vercel supports it immediately. Sometimes the Vercel platform features are announced alongside Next.js features because they're developed together.

### Netlify

Netlify supports Next.js through their runtime adapter. It works well for most use cases, but there are differences:

- **App Router** — Supported, with occasional edge cases
- **Server Components** — Supported, may require specific configuration
- **ISR** — Supported through their adapter
- **Image Optimization** — Requires Netlify Image CDN add-on
- **Edge Functions** — Different API than Vercel's edge middleware
- **Middleware** — Supported with some limitations

Netlify has invested significantly in Next.js support, and for most applications, it works fine. But if you're using cutting-edge Next.js features on day one, Vercel will have fewer surprises.

## Performance Comparison

I've benchmarked both platforms across multiple projects. Here's what I've found:

### Cold Start Performance (Serverless Functions)

| Metric | Vercel | Netlify |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Cold start (simple function) | 150-300ms | 200-400ms |
| Cold start (with DB connection) | 400-700ms | 500-900ms |
| Warm response | 20-50ms | 30-60ms |

Vercel's edge functions are notably faster for cold starts. Their investment in edge computing shows in production.

### Static Asset Delivery

Both platforms use global CDNs and deliver static assets quickly. In practice:

| Metric | Vercel | Netlify |
|--------|--------|---------|
| TTFB (cached, US) | 10-30ms | 15-35ms |
| TTFB (cached, EU) | 40-70ms | 45-75ms |
| TTFB (cached, Asia) | 80-120ms | 90-130ms |

The differences are minimal. Both are fast.

### Build Performance

| Metric | Vercel | Netlify |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Average build time (medium project) | 60-120s | 90-150s |
| Build cache effectiveness | Excellent | Good |
| Parallel builds (Pro plans) | Yes | Yes |

Vercel's builds tend to be slightly faster, especially with their Remote Caching for Turborepo projects.

## Feature Comparison

### Serverless Functions

**Vercel:**
- Edge Functions (run at CDN edge, faster cold starts)
- Serverless Functions (Node.js, Python, Go, Ruby)
- Edge Middleware (for routing, auth, rewrites)
- 10-second default timeout (30s Pro, 300s Enterprise)

**Netlify:**
- Edge Functions (Deno-based)
- Netlify Functions (AWS Lambda under the hood)
- Background Functions (15-minute timeout)
- Scheduled Functions (cron jobs)
- 10-second default timeout (26s Pro)

Netlify's background functions are unique—long-running tasks that respond immediately and process in the background. Useful for webhooks and async processing.

### Built-in Features

**Netlify provides out of the box:**
- **Forms** — No-JS form handling with spam filtering
- **Identity** — User authentication and management
- **Large Media** — Git LFS for large files
- **Split Testing** — A/B testing at the edge
- **Deploy Previews** — With authentication options

**Vercel provides out of the box:**
- **Image Optimization** — Automatic format conversion, resizing
- **Analytics** — Real user monitoring
- **Speed Insights** — Core Web Vitals tracking
- **Preview Deployments** — Automatic for every push
- **Cron Jobs** — vercel.json configuration

Netlify's built-in forms and identity are genuine value adds if you need them. Vercel's image optimization is particularly valuable for image-heavy sites.

### Environment and CI/CD

**Both platforms offer:**
- Git integration (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- Environment variables management
- Rollback to previous deployments
- Custom domains with automatic SSL

**Vercel advantages:**
- Deeper GitHub integration (comments, checks)
- Remote caching for monorepos
- Better Turborepo integration (they own it)

**Netlify advantages:**
- More flexible build settings
- Plugin ecosystem for build customization
- Better support for non-JavaScript build tools

## Pricing Comparison

This is where the comparison gets interesting—and where I see people make costly mistakes.

### Free Tier

| Feature | Vercel | Netlify |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Bandwidth | 100GB/month | 100GB/month |
| Serverless invocations | 100GB-hrs | 125K/month |
| Build minutes | 6,000/month | 300/month |
| Team members | 1 | 1 |
| Commercial use | Limited | Yes |

Important note: Vercel's free tier is for **hobby** use only. Commercial projects technically require a paid plan. Netlify's free tier allows commercial use.

### Pro Tier

| Feature | Vercel Pro ($20/user/mo) | Netlify Pro ($19/user/mo) |
|---------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Bandwidth | 1TB included | 1TB included |
| Additional bandwidth | $40/100GB | $55/100GB |
| Build minutes | 24,000/month | 25,000/month |
| Serverless invocations | 1,000GB-hrs | Unlimited |
| Team members | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Preview deployments | Unlimited | Unlimited |

### Where Costs Diverge

**Serverless function usage:**
Vercel charges for function execution time (GB-hours). Heavy function usage can get expensive quickly. Netlify includes unlimited function invocations on Pro.

**Bandwidth overages:**
Both charge for excess bandwidth, but Vercel's overage rates are slightly better at scale.

**Enterprise features:**
Both platforms gate advanced features (SOC 2 compliance, SSO, SLAs) behind enterprise pricing that requires sales conversations.

### Real Cost Example

A medium-traffic site I manage:
- 500K page views/month
- 200GB bandwidth
- Moderate serverless function usage

**On Vercel Pro:** ~$60-80/month
**On Netlify Pro:** ~$55-65/month

The difference isn't dramatic for most sites. At very high scale, both get expensive, and the comparison requires specific analysis of your usage patterns.

## Developer Experience

### Vercel

**The Good:**
- Deployment is almost magical. Push to git, site is live.
- Dashboard is clean and informative
- Preview deployments with automatic URLs
- Excellent error messages and debugging
- Native integration with Turborepo and monorepos
- `vercel` CLI is polished

**The Less Good:**
- Some configuration options require vercel.json deep-diving
- Enterprise features require sales conversations
- Less flexibility for non-Node.js workflows

### Netlify

**The Good:**
- Flexible build configuration
- Plugin ecosystem for extending builds
- Forms and Identity genuinely useful
- netlify.toml gives fine-grained control
- Background Functions for long-running tasks
- More transparent pricing at scale

**The Less Good:**
- Next.js support occasionally lags
- Dashboard can feel cluttered
- Some advanced features require configuration

## My Decision Framework

After years of using both, here's how I decide:

### Choose Vercel When:

1. **Next.js is your framework** — The integration is simply better. You'll spend less time debugging platform issues.

2. **Edge performance matters** — Vercel's Edge Functions and Middleware are ahead of the competition.

3. **You use Turborepo** — Vercel owns Turborepo. The remote caching integration is seamless.

4. **Speed to deploy is critical** — Vercel's builds are fast, and the DX is optimized for rapid iteration.

5. **You want analytics built in** — Vercel's Web Analytics and Speed Insights are valuable.

### Choose Netlify When:

1. **Static sites are your focus** — Netlify's original strength remains a strength.

2. **You need built-in forms or auth** — No need to integrate third parties.

3. **Budget predictability matters** — Unlimited function invocations on Pro reduces surprise bills.

4. **Background processing is required** — Background Functions are unique to Netlify.

5. **You're using non-Next.js frameworks** — Astro, Nuxt, SvelteKit work well on Netlify.

6. **Build customization is important** — Netlify's plugin system is more extensible.

## Specific Framework Recommendations

| Framework | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Next.js | Vercel |
| Remix | Either (slight edge to Vercel) |
| SvelteKit | Either |
| Astro | Netlify (simpler for static-first) |
| Nuxt | Either |
| Hugo/Jekyll | Netlify |
| Gatsby | Netlify |
| Pure HTML/CSS/JS | Netlify |

## Migration Considerations

Migrating between platforms is straightforward for most projects:

**Vercel → Netlify:**
1. Add `netlify.toml` configuration
2. Update environment variables
3. Adjust any Vercel-specific configurations (Edge Middleware becomes Edge Functions)
4. Connect your Git repository
5. Deploy

**Netlify → Vercel:**
1. Add `vercel.json` if needed
2. Update environment variables
3. Adjust Netlify-specific features (Forms need alternative, Functions have different API)
4. Connect your Git repository
5. Deploy

For Next.js specifically, moving from Netlify to Vercel often **simplifies** configuration since Vercel's Next.js support is native.

## My Personal Stack

For transparency, here's what I actually use:

**Personal projects and experiments:** Vercel free tier (it's hobby use)

**Client Next.js projects:** Vercel Pro — the deep integration reduces maintenance burden

**Static marketing sites:** Netlify Pro — the built-in forms and simplicity are perfect

**Non-Next.js apps:** Netlify — usually Astro or Hugo, where Netlify shines

I use both regularly. Neither is "better"—they're optimized for different priorities.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use both platforms?

Yes. Some teams use Vercel for their Next.js apps and Netlify for marketing sites. There's no conflict.

### Is Vercel too expensive?

Vercel can get expensive at high scale, particularly with heavy function usage. But for most projects, Pro tier is reasonable. Monitor your usage and set billing alerts.

### Does Netlify support Next.js well enough?

For most applications, yes. If you're using experimental Next.js features or need day-one support for new features, Vercel is safer.

### What about Cloudflare Pages?

Cloudflare Pages is a viable alternative, especially for static sites. Their Workers platform is powerful. But for Next.js specifically, Vercel remains the smoothest experience.

### What about Railway, Render, or Fly.io?

These are more general-purpose hosting platforms that support Next.js but aren't optimized for it. Consider them for applications where you need more control over infrastructure (databases, background workers, etc.).

### Should I self-host instead?

Self-hosting (Docker on AWS/GCP, or bare metal) gives maximum control and can be cheaper at very high scale. But it requires DevOps expertise. For most teams, the managed experience of Vercel/Netlify is worth the cost.

## Final Thoughts

Both Vercel and Netlify are excellent platforms. The developer experience on both is light-years ahead of traditional hosting.

**My default recommendation:**

- **Next.js apps → Vercel**
- **Everything else → Netlify** (unless you have a specific reason otherwise)

This simple heuristic will serve you well for most projects.
