# Gapper

[**Play Gapper**](/climb)

You tap. You gap. You die. You tap again.

That's it. That's the game.

## Why Did I Build This?

Because Flappy Bird ruined my life in 2014 and I wanted to pass that trauma on to others.

Seriously though - there's something beautiful about one-button games. No tutorial needed. No complex controls. Just you, a gap, and your increasingly sweaty thumbs.

## The Rules

1. Press **SPACE** (or tap)
2. Go through the gap
3. Don't hit the rocks
4. Repeat until you inevitably fail
5. Convince yourself you can do better
6. You can't
7. Try anyway

## The Numbers

```typescript
const GRAVITY = 0.5 // Floaty enough to feel hopeful
const JUMP_FORCE = -11 // Punchy enough to feel powerful
const INITIAL_SPEED = 4 // Fast enough to panic
const SPEED_INCREMENT = 0.002 // Slow enough to not notice until it's too late
const GAP_SIZE = 255 // Generous. I'm not a monster.
```

## What Makes It Evil

The speed increases every frame. It's barely noticeable at first. "This is easy," you think at score 5. "I'm basically a pro," you say at score 15.

Then you're at score 25 and the rocks are flying at you like they have a personal vendetta and suddenly you understand why your high score is 31 and you've been playing for 45 minutes.

## My High Score

I'm not telling you. It's embarrassing.

## Your Turn

Don't say I didn't warn you.
