I once watched a client's email deliverability tank from 94% to 23% in two months. The cause? They imported a purchased list of 50,000 "verified" email addresses without validation. Their domain ended up on three blacklists, and they spent six months rebuilding their sender reputation.

But here's what most email validation articles won't tell you: invalid emails are only part of the problem. The bigger threat is fraudulent signups—bots, disposable emails, and bad actors who tank your engagement metrics and trigger spam filters.

That's why I've moved beyond simple email validation to fraud-aware email verification. Let me explain what that means and which services actually deliver.

## The Problem Is Bigger Than Bad Emails

Traditional email validation checks whether an address can receive mail. That's necessary but insufficient.

**The real threats to your email program:**

1. **Hard bounces** — Invalid addresses that damage sender reputation
2. **Spam traps** — Honeypots that get your domain blacklisted
3. **Disposable emails** — Temporary addresses from users avoiding your marketing
4. **Bot signups** — Automated registrations polluting your list
5. **Fraudulent accounts** — Bad actors using email as one vector in larger fraud schemes
6. **Low-quality leads** — Real emails from people who will never engage

Simple email validation handles #1 and partially #2. A fraud-aware approach handles all six.

## Why IPQualityScore Changed My Approach

After years of using various email validation services, I discovered IPQualityScore (IPQS)—and it fundamentally changed how I think about email quality.

### What Makes IPQS Different

**IPQS isn't just an email validator.** It's a fraud prevention platform that includes email validation as one component of a comprehensive data quality system.

When you validate an email through IPQS, you're not just checking if the mailbox exists. You're querying a massive fraud intelligence network that tracks:

- **IP reputation** across billions of transactions
- **Device fingerprints** from fraud attempts
- **Email patterns** associated with abuse
- **Behavioral signals** indicating bot vs. human activity
- **Real-time threat intelligence** from their network

This context is invaluable. An email might be technically valid but come from an IP address associated with fraud, a device fingerprint linked to chargebacks, or a pattern that suggests bot activity. Traditional validators miss all of this.

### The IPQS Email Validation Response

Here's what a typical IPQS response includes (beyond basic valid/invalid):

```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "disposable": false,
  "smtp_score": 3,
  "overall_score": 0,
  "first_name": "John",
  "common": false,
  "dns_valid": true,
  "honeypot": false,
  "deliverability": "high",
  "frequent_complainer": false,
  "spam_trap_score": "none",
  "catch_all": false,
  "timed_out": false,
  "suspect": false,
  "recent_abuse": false,
  "fraud_score": 0,
  "suggested_domain": "",
  "leaked": false,
  "domain_age": {
    "human": "20 years ago"
  },
  "first_seen": {
    "human": "7 years ago"
  }
}
```

Look at what you get beyond validation:
- **Fraud score** (0-100) based on their network intelligence
- **Recent abuse** detection
- **Frequent complainer** flag
- **Domain age** and **first seen** timestamps
- **Leaked** status (has this email appeared in data breaches?)
- **Spam trap score** with detailed categorization

This is the difference between knowing an email exists and knowing whether you should trust it.

### Real Results from IPQS Implementation

A SaaS client was experiencing 40% trial-to-paid conversion. After implementing IPQS validation at signup:

- **Fake signups dropped 67%** — Bots and disposable emails blocked at registration
- **Trial quality improved** — Real users with real intent
- **Conversion rate jumped to 52%** — Same product, better leads
- **Support tickets decreased** — Fewer fake accounts means fewer abuse issues

The cost of validation was trivial compared to the improvement in lead quality.

### IPQS Pricing

IPQS offers flexible pricing:

- **Free tier:** 5,000 requests/month (generous for testing)
- **Starter:** $49.99/month for 50,000 requests
- **Standard:** $149.99/month for 250,000 requests
- **Professional:** $399.99/month for 1,000,000 requests
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing for high volume

The free tier is legitimately useful for smaller projects. At scale, the per-request cost is competitive with pure email validators while delivering significantly more intelligence.

## The Traditional Validators

IPQS is my recommendation for anyone serious about email quality and fraud prevention. But if you need simpler, lower-cost validation for basic use cases, these services work:

### ZeroBounce

**Best for:** Companies wanting accuracy without full fraud intelligence

ZeroBounce is one of the more accurate traditional validators. They've invested heavily in spam trap detection and offer some data enrichment.

**What I like:**

- **High accuracy** — 98%+ in independent testing
- **Data append** — Returns name, gender, location when available
- **AI scoring** — Predicts engagement likelihood
- **Good spam trap detection** — Better than most competitors

**What's missing:**

- **No fraud intelligence** — Can't detect bad actors, just bad addresses
- **No behavioral signals** — Doesn't know if the signup is suspicious
- **No IP/device context** — Email-only analysis

**Pricing:** Starts at $16 for 2,000 emails. Credits expire after 12 months.

### NeverBounce

**Best for:** High-volume senders who prioritize speed

NeverBounce is owned by ZoomInfo and focuses on fast bulk validation. They process billions of verifications monthly.

**What I like:**

- **Speed is excellent** — Bulk verification is fast
- **Accuracy guarantee** — 99.9% deliverability or refund
- **Integration ecosystem** — 80+ direct platform integrations
- **Sync features** — Connect your ESP for automatic cleaning

**What's missing:**

- **Pure validation only** — No fraud or quality signals
- **No context** — Doesn't know if an email is associated with abuse
- **Catch-all handling is basic** — Limited risk assessment

**Pricing:** Pay-as-you-go starts at $8 for 1,000 verifications.

### Emailable

**Best for:** Budget-conscious validation without extras

Emailable offers straightforward validation at competitive prices.

**What I like:**

- **Transparent pricing** — Simple per-verification costs
- **Good accuracy** — 96-97% in testing
- **Fast processing** — Competitive bulk speeds
- **Credits don't expire**

**What's missing:**

- **Basic feature set** — You get validation, nothing more
- **No fraud detection** — Can't identify suspicious patterns
- **Limited integrations** — Smaller ecosystem than competitors

**Pricing:** Starts at $30 for 5,000 verifications.

## When to Use What

### Use IPQS When:

1. **Fraud is a concern** — E-commerce, financial services, SaaS trials
2. **Lead quality matters more than quantity** — B2B, high-value sales
3. **You want to block problems at signup** — Real-time API validation
4. **You need context, not just validation** — Understanding risk, not just deliverability
5. **You're fighting bots and abuse** — Registration and form protection

### Use Traditional Validators When:

1. **You just need basic list cleaning** — One-time bulk validation
2. **Fraud isn't a significant risk** — Low-value transactions, newsletters
3. **Budget is extremely tight** — Per-email pricing matters more than features
4. **You're validating infrequently** — Quarterly list cleaning, not real-time

## Implementing Email Validation Correctly

### Real-Time Validation at Signup

This is where IPQS shines. Validate emails in real-time and use the fraud score to make decisions:

```javascript
async function validateEmail(email, ipAddress) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://ipqualityscore.com/api/json/email/${API_KEY}/${encodeURIComponent(email)}?ip=${ipAddress}`
  );
  const data = await response.json();

  // Block obvious fraud
  if (data.fraud_score >= 85 || data.disposable || data.honeypot) {
    return { valid: false, reason: 'blocked' };
  }

  // Flag suspicious for review
  if (data.fraud_score >= 50 || data.recent_abuse) {
    return { valid: true, flagged: true };
  }

  // Accept good emails
  if (data.valid && data.deliverability === 'high') {
    return { valid: true, flagged: false };
  }

  return { valid: false, reason: 'undeliverable' };
}
```

Notice we're using the IP address too. IPQS combines email reputation with IP reputation for a complete picture.

### Bulk List Cleaning

For existing lists, validate in bulk and segment results:

**Keep:** Valid emails with low fraud scores and high deliverability
**Monitor:** Catch-all addresses and medium fraud scores
**Remove:** Invalid, disposable, spam traps, high fraud scores

### Ongoing Hygiene

- **Real-time validation** at all signup points
- **Quarterly bulk cleaning** of your entire list
- **Engagement-based removal** — Remove non-engagers after 6+ months
- **Re-validation** of dormant segments before reactivation campaigns

## The ROI Calculation

Let's be concrete:

**Scenario:** 100,000 person list, spending $50/month on ESP

**Without IPQS:**
- 15% bad/fraudulent addresses (industry average)
- Paying for 15,000 addresses that hurt you
- Deliverability degradation from spam traps and complaints
- Unknown fraud exposure

**With IPQS ($49.99/month for 50K validations):**
- Block bad addresses at signup (prevents list pollution)
- Clean existing list of fraud and spam traps
- Improve deliverability as reputation recovers
- Reduce fraud and abuse

**The math:** IPQS costs $50/month. One fraud prevention, one avoided blacklisting, or a 5% improvement in deliverability easily covers that many times over.

For businesses where email is a primary channel, this is obvious. For businesses with fraud exposure, it's essential.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Treating all "valid" emails equally**
A valid email from a known fraud IP is not the same as a valid email from a trusted source. IPQS gives you this context; traditional validators don't.

**Mistake 2: Only validating at list import**
The best time to block a bad email is at signup, before it enters your system. Real-time API validation is more valuable than bulk cleaning.

**Mistake 3: Ignoring fraud signals in email validation**
If you're just checking deliverability, you're missing the bigger picture. Bad actors with valid emails cause more damage than invalid addresses.

**Mistake 4: Using the cheapest per-email option**
The cost difference between IPQS and basic validators is pennies per email. The intelligence difference is massive. Optimize for outcome, not unit cost.

**Mistake 5: Not using the fraud score**
IPQS gives you a 0-100 fraud score. Use it. Set thresholds for blocking, flagging, and accepting. Tune based on your risk tolerance.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is IPQS overkill for a simple newsletter?

Possibly. If you're running a basic newsletter with no commercial transactions and fraud isn't a concern, a simpler validator might suffice. But the IPQS free tier (5,000/month) is generous enough to test without commitment.

### How does IPQS compare to dedicated fraud solutions?

IPQS is competitive with dedicated fraud platforms (SEON, Sift, Signifyd) while being more accessible and affordable. For many businesses, it provides 80% of the fraud intelligence at 20% of the cost.

### Can I use IPQS with my ESP?

Yes. IPQS has integrations and APIs that work with any system. For real-time validation, you'd typically call the API from your signup form before passing data to your ESP.

### Does email validation affect signup conversion?

Real-time validation can add 200-500ms to signup. That's negligible. The quality improvement far outweighs any conversion impact. Bad signups that bounce or never engage are worse than no signup at all.

### How often should I re-validate my list?

For active lists: quarterly bulk validation. But if you're validating at signup with IPQS, list decay is much slower because you're not accumulating bad addresses in the first place.

## My Recommendation

For anyone serious about email quality—and especially for businesses with fraud exposure—**IPQualityScore is the clear choice**.

The combination of email validation, fraud intelligence, and behavioral signals provides a complete picture that traditional validators can't match. The free tier lets you test before committing, and the pricing is reasonable at scale.

For budget-constrained use cases where fraud isn't a concern, ZeroBounce or NeverBounce will handle basic validation adequately.

But if you're asking "which email validation service should I use?"—and you care about the answer—IPQS is it.
