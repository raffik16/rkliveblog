# Free Solo Climber

[**Play the game now**](/climb)

One button. Endless climbing. How far can you go?

## The Concept

**Free Solo Climber** takes the addictive simplicity of Flappy Bird and wraps it in a rock climbing theme. You control a climber navigating through gaps in an endless rock face. Tap or press space to jump. That's it.

The twist? Speed increases over time. What starts as a leisurely climb becomes an intense test of reflexes.

## How to Play

- **SPACE** or **TAP** - Jump
- Navigate through the gaps
- Each gap passed = 1 point
- Speed increases as you climb
- Hit a rock = game over

## The Mechanics

```typescript
const GRAVITY = 0.6
const JUMP_FORCE = -12
const INITIAL_SPEED = 2
const SPEED_INCREMENT = 0.001
```

Every frame, speed increases slightly. By the time you hit 20+ points, you're moving significantly faster than when you started.

## Why It's Addictive

1. **Instant restart** - Tap and you're climbing again
2. **Clear goal** - Beat your high score
3. **Escalating difficulty** - Speed ramps up naturally
4. **High score persistence** - Your best is saved locally
5. **Shareable scores** - Brag to your friends
